## MyResume

# Input
The app doesn’t take input directly from a user but instead relies on details I entered while building it. I added my name, contact info, education, work experience, and projects into the `Resume.js` file. These act as the inputs that shape what the app will display. I also included a `Resume.css` file to control the design and layout of the resume.

# Process
When the app runs, React takes the content from `Resume.js` and generates the HTML for the resume. It uses the styles from `Resume.css` to format everything, like making headings stand out and ensuring the layout looks clean. The app’s "processing" is essentially React organizing and combining the content and styles into a functional webpage.

# Output
The result is a professional-looking resume that’s displayed in the browser. It shows all the details I provided—name, education, experience, and projects—organized and styled for easy reading. The goal is to create a polished and shareable resume that looks great on any screen.
